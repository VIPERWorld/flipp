##Flexible integrated parser and plotter

This program will provide an interface to do the following:

1. Connect to a TCP, UDP, or serial data stream.
2. Build a set of variables to look for in the stream.
3. Plot the values found in the stream in real time.

Right now only the first two are in place. I am working on the parser engine, while at the same time iterating over a number of UIs to provide an intuitive and efficient workflow.

This is very much a work in progress.
